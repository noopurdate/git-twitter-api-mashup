Following are few instructions to build/run API mashup -->

This code can be executed by changing the values in application.properties under folder com.ndstudios.main.
The output file name needs to be changed according to your preferences

To execute the code user can run it from eclipse by running ApiMashup.java class as Java application.
I have added the ant script for to generate an executable jar, so the by running ApiMashup.xml as Ant Build.

It will create an executable jar under project folder and by double clicking on it, or running from command prompt will run the mashup and build output json at desired location stated in application.properties file.

If you need anymore information from me, please let me know.
